Open Data ideas:
- [International Brain Laboratory Behavioral Data Portal (mice data)](https://data.internationalbrainlab.org/) : Behavioral data from a standardized training pipeline, implemented across 9 labs in 7 institutions. Mice learn to make decisions that combine incoming visual evidence with internal beliefs about the dynamic structure of the environment. Through this portal, users can view behavioral data from mice throughout their training, and see the transition from novice to expert behavior unfold.
- [Open Datasets from Behavioral Brain Research journal](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/behavioural-brain-research/mendeley-datasets)
- [Neuroscience Information Framework registry of data resources](https://neuinfo.org/data/search?q=*&t=registry&ff=Resource%20Type:data%20set#all)
- [Meteorite landings (NASA)](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh): This comprehensive data set from The Meteoritical Society contains information on all of the known meteorite landings. (Pretty big)
