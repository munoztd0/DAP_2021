# DAP_2021
Data Analysis Porject fo S&amp;P class 2021

The DAP must contain:
- an initial description of data set, sample sizes, types of variables
- potential questions of interest
- pre-processing
- at least two "kinds" of statistical report
- conlusions

What we expect from you (not exhaustive)

- reproducible research (everything should be contained in a single Rmarkdown file that outputs a pdf)
- upload new documents by firday afternoon

Open Data ideas:
- [International Brain Laboratory Behavioral Data Portal (mice data)](https://data.internationalbrainlab.org/) : Behavioral data from a standardized training pipeline, implemented across 9 labs in 7 institutions. Mice learn to make decisions that combine incoming visual evidence with internal beliefs about the dynamic structure of the environment. Through this portal, users can view behavioral data from mice throughout their training, and see the transition from novice to expert behavior unfold.
- [jpah2016 (Permuco Package in R)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/permuco/permuco.pdf): A subset of a control experiment measuring the impulsive approach tendencies toward physical activity or sedentary behaviors.
- [EmergencyCost (Permuco Package in R)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/permuco/permuco.pdf): Observational data from 176 emergency patients with variables 
- [The R Datasets Package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html): A bunch of different datasets
- [Open Datasets from Behavioral Brain Research journal](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/behavioural-brain-research/mendeley-datasets)
- [Neuroscience Information Framework registry of data resources](https://neuinfo.org/data/search?q=*&t=registry&ff=Resource%20Type:data%20set#all)
- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=): A bunch of different datasets
- [Meteorite landings (NASA)](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh): This comprehensive data set from The Meteoritical Society contains information on all of the known meteorite landings. (Pretty big)
