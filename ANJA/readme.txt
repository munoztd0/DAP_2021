Original paper: Automated analysis of connected speech reveals early biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder by Jan Hlavnička, Roman Čmejla, Tereza Tykalová, Karel Šonka, Evžen Růžička & Jan Rusz 


We have 131 observations, including 30 patients with early PD, 50 with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and 50 healthy controls.


The data project question would be “Predicting early PD in patients with RBD based on dysfunctional connected speech”


So I would like to examine, if I can predict, dependent on connected speech, if a patient with RBD is prone to develop Parkinson disease.

The dependent variable here would be patient with or without Parkinson`s disease and the independent variable the connected speech.


Here the similarities to may own research project would be, that I am looking to find differences of temperatures in healthy subjects and patients with neurodegenerative diseases and in this project I would like to find differences in connected speech in healthy subjects and patients with RBD which could develop PD.
