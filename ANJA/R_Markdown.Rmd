```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(vtable)
library(GGally)
library(ggfortify)
library(stargazer)
```

## R Markdown
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./iris.jpg')
```

```{r, results='asis'}
iris$Species <- as.factor(iris$Species)
sumtable(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all'}
# Suppress binwidth warnings adapted from https://github.com/ggobi/ggally/issues/184
ggpairs(iris, progress=FALSE, lower=list(combo=wrap("facethist", binwidth=0.8)))
```

## Model

```{r}
m1 <- lm (data=iris, Sepal.Length ~ Species)
m2 <- lm (data=iris, Petal.Length ~ Species)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
#stargazer(m1, m2)
```
### Autoplot for species as predictor for petal length
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.keep='all'}
autoplot(m2)
```

# Report
In this analysis I wanted to see, if Species is a good predictor for Sepal.Length and Petal.Length.
First I produces a table to get a good summary of my variables. After that I generated a ggpairs plot, to see if there are any correlating variables. After that I generated linear model to see, if the factor species is indeed a good predictor for both of the variables.
As seen in the first linear model, the prediction for sepal length shows an R^2 of 0.619 and the second model for the prediction of petal lenth shows an R^2 of 0.941. Both have a good p-value.
As the prediction of Petal.legth with Species as a predictor is even better, I here generated an autoplot to confirm. Here the residuals are radnomly distributed around the horizontal line and the Normal Q-Q plot doesnt show any extreme outliers. So it seems we have a good model.
