#dataset 1: Affective ratings
#In this experiment, 360 words were shown. 120 eliciting disgust, 120 fear and 120 were neutral.
#The aim of the experiment was to see if the participants could remember pairs of words of an emotion and if this emotions had an impact on how they were remembered. 
# title of the article: Distinct medial-temporal lobe mechanisms of encoding and amygdala-mediated memory reinstatement for disgust and fear https://doi.org/10.1101/825844
#On this analysis, we focus on the control variable of self ratings of the emotion activation that were answered at the presentation of the words.
#DV: affective ratings on a Likert-like scale
#IV1: Gender (F or M)
#IV2: the emotion (Disgust, fear or neutral)
#not used IVs: memory tasks
#question1: How gender and emotion of words influence affective ratings?
#question2: can the affective ratings and the gender predict which emotion was elicited?


#dataset 2: relaxation techniques on physiological rates
#In this experiment, two relaxation techniques ("yogique and meditation") were used to analyse it's impact on heart rating, breath rating and the interaction between the two.
#IV1: relaxation techniques
#IV2: order of technique passation 
#DV: heart rate, breath rate and heart rate variance
