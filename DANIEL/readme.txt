#Dataset 1: Affective ratings
In this experiment, 360 words were shown. 120 eliciting disgust, 120 fear and 120 were neutral.
The aim of the experiment was to see if the participants could remember pairs of words of an emotion and if this emotions had an impact on how they were remembered.

In this analysis, we focus on the control self rating of the emotion elicitation that were answered at the presentation of the words.
DV: affective ratings on a Likert scale
IV1: Gender (F or M)
IV2: the emotion (Disgust, fear or neutral)
not used IVs: memory tasks
question: How gender and emotion of words influence affective ratings


#dataset 2: relaxation techniques on physiological rates
In this experiment, two relaxation techniques ("yogique and meditation") were used to analyse it's impact on heart rating, breath rating and the interaction between the two.
IV: relaxation technique
DV: heart rate, breath rate and heart variance rate
